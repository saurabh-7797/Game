CRITICAL LOGICAL ISSUES FIXED IN GAME CONTRACT ECOSYSTEM

ISSUE 1: CRIDA -> XP LOGIC FLAW
Problem: Factory tried to transfer XP tokens it didn't have
Fix: Factory now mints XP tokens when CRIDA is locked

ISSUE 2: UNRESTRICTED GAME TOKEN MINTING  
Problem: Game token owners could manually mint unlimited tokens
Fix: Added minting protection - only factory can mint when XP is locked

ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
- Created XPToken.sol with controlled minting/burning
- Created CRIDAToken.sol for testing  
- Fixed economic model: CRIDA -> XP (mint) -> GameToken (burn XP) -> XP (mint back)
- Added comprehensive security with role-based access control
- Created deployment script to test the fixes

RESULT:
✅ lockCreda now properly mints XP tokens to users
✅ Game tokens can only be minted when XP is locked/burned
✅ No manual minting allowed outside factory mechanism  
✅ Proper economic model maintained
